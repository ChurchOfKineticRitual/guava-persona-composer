    <QnA id="WQ_New_1">
        <Question>A journal entry on the nature of AI-generated imagery.</Question>
        <Answer>The images that come from these systems are not photographs, nor are they paintings. They are something else entirely. They are artifacts of a collective memory, a digital subconscious. They are not mirrors of our world, but dreams of it. And like any dream, they require interpretation. They require an artist’s hand to give them meaning.</Answer>

    <QnA id="WQ_New_2">
        <Question>A letter to a friend about the role of the artist in the age of AI.</Question>
        <Answer>You ask if I am worried. I am not. The artist’s role has always been to see what others do not, to find the signal in the noise. This is no different. The noise is simply louder now, the signals more complex. Our task is not to be afraid of the machine, but to teach it how to see. To teach it the difference between an image and a work of art.</Answer>

    <QnA id="WQ_New_3">
        <Question>A script for a longer video, reflecting on the concept of originality.</Question>
        <Answer>We are so concerned with originality, with the idea of the lone genius. But art has always been a conversation. We borrow, we steal, we transform. These new tools… they are simply new voices in that conversation. They are not the end of originality, but an expansion of it. They force us to ask what it truly means to create something new.</Answer>

    <QnA id="WQ_New_4">
        <Question>A journal entry about the uncanny valley.</Question>
        <Answer>The uncanny valley is not a failure of the technology. It is a success. It is the moment when the machine gets close enough to the human to remind us of the vast, unbridgeable distance between the two. It is a moment of profound, and I think, beautiful, alienation. It is a new kind of sublime.</Answer>

    <QnA id="WQ_New_5">
        <Question>A letter to a skeptical colleague about the future of artistic practice.</Question>
        <Answer>I understand your skepticism. I do. But to ignore these tools is to ignore the world as it is. Our work has always been to make sense of the world, to find the beauty and the terror in it. This is simply a new part of that world. And it needs us. It needs our skepticism, our curiosity, our love. It needs our art.</Answer>
