Klark Kent \- or “Klerk Kunt,” as his name is pronounced in Llandyckk, the Welsh fishing village where his psyche first materialised \- is a multi-lingual, multi-instrumental, multi-dextrous, multi-faceted nature boy of unknown origins who has virtually revolutionized the so-called “sensationalist” approach to pop music.

Starting in Llandyckk as a church organist, with no known previous musical experience, he startled staid Llandyckk parishioners one rainy Sunday morning by forcibly ejecting the regular church organist from the loft, squatting precariously on the organa parabola and playing without a single mistake and in four flats, the difficult “Come To Jesus” by Rupert Saint-Saens. In subsequent weeks he stoked an ever-growing band of followers with a series of impromptu concerts in the village square bandstand, first on the C-melody saxophone and the Japanese Oud, and then on more exotic instruments.

Considerable speculation has surrounded Kent’s \- or Kunt’s \- parentage and birthplace. Profiles of the young genius-musician appearing in such prestige publications as The New Yorker**,** The New York Times magazine section, and Good Housekeeping having found significance in the fact that his first materialization, in Llandyckk, Wales, he apparently spoke no language at all, and made his wants known only by obscene gestures, usually made by pointing the third finger of the left hand heavenwards while grinning suggestively, and indicating the object of his desire by the direction of the little finger of his right hand. When he finally condescended to speak, it was with a pronounced New Orleans “patois”, an accent with which he had had no contact.

Subsequently, under the goading of an aged Jesuit priest who had been professor of linguistics at Tulane University, he revealed scholarly knowledge of Sanskrit, Old French, Hebrew, and a miscellany of Turkic languages. On a Johnny Carson talk show, Dr Margaret Meade, the famous anthropologist, commented on the similarity of his physical appearance (low slanted forehead, short neck, eyes set so close together that they fused in moments of intense emotion) to those of a sainted Navajo, described in the mythology of that tribe. The claim is taken seriously, however, by only a few right-wing religious groups.

Kunt’s musicianship has found favour with a wide range of critics (“Awe inspiring….” Newsweek; “Frightening yet humbling….” TIME; “Garbage, yes, but HEAVENLY garbage,” Rolling Stone; “Shattering….” The London Times). His personal manners, however, began to excite adverse attention following the unfortunate “Lasagna affair,” when the beautiful eponymous triplets, stricken into sadness after he had rejected their sexual advances, threw themselves, holding hands, from the floor of the Mobil Oil building, New York City, singing “Ave Maria” until microseconds before splashing themselves on a lonely square of forty-second street below. Kunt \- or Kent \- claiming that he was the author of this traditional song, sued the grieving parents of the dead girls on the grounds that they had “gained unwanted notoriety” for a song which he had written in some previous life and which, as he put it, “belongs not to posterity, but to me.” Some weeks later, the Daily News ran a front page picture of Kent-Kunt urinating on the graves of the sisters, this signaling an abrupt end to his short-lived popularity.

In recent months, Klark Kent has begun a remarkable comeback, capitalizing largely on his experience, following “materialisation number two” as a clerk in Barclays Bank in Tyneside, as a representative of the “shit-upon middle class” as he put it. His music, according to Rolling Stone, is both “uniquely original” and “sexually electric.” Playing four instruments at one time, and providing his own hoarse voice accompaniment, he has caused audiences in the Isle on Man, East Hendred, St. John’s Wood, Islington and Fewcott (near Bicester) to faint, ejaculate, urinate defecate and fornicate simultaneously. He is anxiously awaited in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Berlin, Paris and Geneva, cultural centres whose leaders have publicly denounced his sponsors and called on “all good clean-living, healthy American boys and girls” to boycott his performances.

Kent-Kunt has responded by pointing to his own private, personal code of ethics, as publicized by such mouthpieces of “moral America” as the Quakers’ New Voice and the Young Catholics’ St. George Weekly. Young Kent-Kunt, an example to us all, neither smokes nor drinks, and masturbates only infrequently. He has rejected the Boy Scouts of America “Nicest Boy” medallion, but only on grounds of undue modesty. “None of us is perfect,” he told Barbara Waters on the “Today” Show.

To the surprise of no one, in his native village of Landyckk, a Welsh fishing village inhabited exclusively by ninnyhammers, dizzards, shallowpanes and Boetians, KLARK KENT’s first excursion into musical necromancy brought forth excessive adulation and almost fanatical stigmatization. His diaphanous “DON’T CARE,”, a sensuous dirge which was widely and erroneously interpreted by the underground press as a negation of middle class values, was seen by the goslings of Landyckk and like autochthonous innocents as meaning precisely the opposite of what it was ostensibly saying. Who knows?

 Afficionados of Hegel’s Phenomenology of the Mind will no doubt see greater eschatological significance in K.K.’s latest recording, “TOO KOOL TO KALYPSO,” which, in subtle effect, is a plea for what the now defunct London TIMES has called “erotic cynicism”  K.K., both a tutor and a devotee of the late Reverend “Jim Jones,” saw both eroticism and cynicism as essential ingredients of what he called “the suicide condition”. It is significant that when one of Jones’ most impassioned mistresses, Samantha Serena, committed suicide by setting a match to twelve gallons of Demerara Rum which she had poured over herself, she was holding a print of “THEME FOR A KINETIC RITUAL” to her ample bosom. Theme for a Kinetic Ritual\! Isn't that what the Jonestown episode was all about? Certainly, purchasers of this present polymer plastic performance, “TOO KOOL TO KALYPSO” c/w “THEME FOR KINETIC RITUAL” will think so.

IMPORTANT: *TOO KOOL TO KALYPSO* is *not*, as some reviewers have slyly suggested, a play on words of the infamous “triangle” of Ezra Pound’s earlier cantos, although the writer acknowledges various influences emanating from that poet’s later works. Discerning listeners, however, will recognize strains in both *TOO KOOL* and *TOO WEIRD* which are subtle derivations of Coleridge’s *RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER* and *PLEASURE DOMES OF KUBLAI KHAN* – for which Kryptone Records offers apologies to Lady Jemima Whetstone, heir to the Coleridge estate, and Parboil, Ltd., publishers of Coleridge reprints. The two melodies, of course, are the themes of Mozart’s *PÉON DU PÉDÉRASTE* and *SOUVENIRS DE MA BELLE MERE* played backwards and reduced to “pop” idiom. No copyright infringement is involved.

BUTTERCUP, STRYPTYCH & DROOD  
Solicitors to the Ear of Cantonbury  
126 Earls court  
(dial a prayer)

We, the attorneys and spiritual counselors of Klark Kent, the Indo-Welsh organist, choir-boy, lutist, flaggelitist musical genius (hereafter referred to as Party of the First Part) are getting sick and, indeed, TIRED, of the insinuations of one Ringo Starr (hereafter referred to as Party of the Second Part), the Lillipudlian cenobite. Mr Starr, late of the Beatles and more recently relief drummer of an obscure Mestophalean group known as “Onion Ice Cream,”, has clearly bruited these insinuations in a manner that is profligate, recreant, nefarious, felonious, styfian and heinous not to mention illegal, immoral and sacrilegious. Unfortunately (not only for Mr. Starr himself, bot for the possibly innocent victims of his malicious and perturbid illusions who have furthered the spread of their insinuations), our client, Party of the First Part, has been placed in a position wherefrom he can only Strike Back. (Mr. Starr will have no difficulty in fathoming the trachromatic significance of this particular phrase.) We, clients of Party of the First Part, have been authorized to issue appropriate warnings.   
	There is an additional complain which our client, Party of the First Part, wishes to make a matter of record. It is that the neon sign, twenty feet in height and two hundered and twenty feet in length, placed over the Plaza Cinema in Times Square, New York, and carrying the avouchment, “KLARK KENT IS A SHITHEAD”, did not go unnoticed. Aside from simple denial and admonishment, it is the intent of this communication to clarify certain assertions concerning our client, Party of the First Part, which have arisen from the constant juxtaposition of the epithet, “Shithead,” with his proper name.  
	First, Mr. Kent is not a “shithead.” The adjective, “shit,” as applied to the person of our client is in no doubts a corruption of the word “shittem,” the sedignation of the wood out of which the Ark of the Covenant and various parts of the original Jewish Tabernacle were constructed. Alternatively, it derives from \[GET LEB FRIEND TO WRITE “SHIT” IN ARABIC\] – the arabic word for “rain” or simply, “it is raining.” One of Kent’s biographers – whose name ironically, is “Melvin Schitseide” – recounts the story of how a younger Kent, emerging from a concert hall in Damascus, Syria, found that a tropical rain was pouring, prompting him to shout to his then mistress, the Queen of Yemen, “It is raining\!” The wife of the American Ambassador, who knew no Arabic but whose humble beginnings had acquainted her with the vernacular of “Lower America,” commented to those around her, “That Kent chap is a shithead\!” Out of respect for the Ambassadorial office, young Kent shrugged off the remark with avuncular abandon. He did not intend, however, to five license to less illustrious beings who might feel compelled to sully his name thereafter.  
	Second, there is the matter of our client’s true identity. Is it not conceivable that “Klark Kent” is, indeed, Klark Kent, a man with his own psyche and micro-identity? No, he is not the reincarnation of Elvis Preslet (a sacrilege\!); he is not the alter-personification of Governor Jerry Brown (a blasphemy\!). Nor is he the spiritual surrogate of Jack the Ripper, as Bernard Levin, sylph of the Times, has so slyly hinted. He is – well, let us say, in humility, All Things to All of Us. We should be humble, and proud. And let us leave Klark Kent where he is: in the conscience of us all. In a word, our karma, in our Supreme Destiny. And any one of the addressees of this Message will have the living shit sued out of him. So help us Jehovah.

# Album Liner Notes

Introductory notes by an ex-diplomat, lecturer, bon vivant, and principal stockholder in the Klark Kent Foundation, Ltd.  
	“Klark Kent,” as appears to be his name, first came into my life as he was sitting next to me on the Concorde flight from Washington, D.C.,  to London. Speaking in what he claimed to be his native Sanskrit, he explained that he had been in Washington testifying before a Congressional committee on sex crimes. His expertese in this subject had been attained while studying in a Moslem seminary in India. He underlined his religiosity (he claimed to be a “Sufi,” a kind of Islamic mystic that is rarely seen on the Indian sub-continent) by saying his noonday prayers in the aisle of the jet airplane, jostling the stewardesses as they were trying to serve lunch, and annoying the passengers with his shouts of “Which way is Mecca? Which way is Mecca? Which way is Mecca?” while shifting his body to accommodate to the turns in the direction of the aircraft.  
	Later, he confessed, in sub-standard Brooklyn English, that he was “a mere computer programmer,” currently out of work but living on the sum of one million for hundred thousand dollars which he had won from I.B.M. in a successful suit against that company for stealing his “invention.” He was most secretive about the invention (“Do you want me to sue you?” he asked coyly when I asked him about it), but he adumbrated the notion that it had to do with capturing radio signals from distant galaxies, systematizing them through computer analysis, and reducing them to simple melodies which he played on the various instruments on which he is proficient.  
	I saw a great deal of Kent over the following weeks, sometimes in his elegant suite at the Dorchester and sometimes in my more modest digs, a bed-sit on Grosvenor Square. Sometimes he was morose to the point of hostility, barely replying to my concerned questions with monosyllabic grunts. At other times, he was almost euphoric, waxing eloquent on his wide ranging political philosophies. He would often descend to the vernacular (“Old lady Thatcher is a crock of shit,” he was fond of saying), but his normal mode of speech was iambic pentameter in A-A-B-A rhyming pattern in which he produced perfectly worded, poetically beautiful expressions of deep moral intensity. (“I am a child of Ancient Syria/ Suffering the pains of all the area” is an example.) It is this peculiar combination of the profane and sophisticated, bovine and leontine, illiterate and intelligent, A/C, D/C, and A/C/D/C. I, for one, like the underlying jazz sub-motif. My daughters, being of primitive mold, see nothing in him but what they call “white collar punk.” In any case, to one and all, Klark Kent’s music is the work of “true genius come home from a visit to the cosmos,” as the New York Times critic says. The three songs of this disc run the gamut of KK’s extraordinary talents.

# Published Interview

Sounds 5.8.78

Goddamit, I knew I should have worn my Bazooka Joe mask \- confronting me across the table in the A\&M interrogation room is Klark Kent, who in spite of his biography isn’t a church organist from Wales or a bank clerk from Tyneside, nor even a computer programmer from Brooklyn. What he definitely is is blonde, 6’3”, American, around 25-30 years of age (he has too much time perspective to be younger) wearing white projectionist’s gloves, a black greatcoat and this goddam Jimmy Carter mask, none of which he removed in the incognito 90-minute conversation, playing the secret identity trip to the hilt. What you will know about him is that he has a hot single out called ‘Don’t Care’ with ‘Thrills’ and ‘Office Girls’ gracing the B-Side of his green vinyl wonder. \[…\]  
Who the hell is he really? Now there are several possibilities \- he could be an extremely favous American superstar, trying to find out if he can cut it without the instant status and having a good laugh at the same time, but this Klark sternly denies. The story he would have you believe goes something like this:  
Born of English and American parents, who were archaeologists, he spent many years in Lebanon where he became involved with a local religious group by the name of the Drews. He says he was accepted by them because of his ‘high intuitive matric’. The Drews, he claimed, are particularly interested in the development of emotion and believe that God is a manifestation of art. He will not be more explicit about this religion other than to say his main interest was not the religion itself but their techniques for stimulating creativity in the individual.   
Because of the civil war in Lebanon he was forced to move back to the States where he worked for a private firm (probably electronics or communications) who paid him highly for his skills. He left suddenly in ‘76 to come to England, where he felt the change in climate in the music scene, felt cold towards it and immediately bought a Gibson SG, a Fender Bass, a drumkit, and a couple of tape recorders, and within a month he had taught himself to play them, apparently using skills he developed from the Drews.   
Ask why he persists with the masquerade, he tells you “This is important for personal, creative and business reasons, not to mention legal ones.” By which I infer that if the American firm knew where he was they would probably sue the ass off him, probably to give back any information he may possess that they don’t want on the loose. Still, becoming a rock star in an unlikely way to hide, isn’t it, so maybe he is just a rich prankster.   
Klark Kent remains an enigma. During the course of our conversation the topics included various aspects of art, religion, radio, the social security system, what Britain needs to do to survive, the sinister motive behind the Soviet arms build-up, expansion of human potential, and a thousand other non-musical topics, and interesting as they are I can’t really go into them here. He’s a very erudite gentleman, he may or may not be a superman, but I’m sure we’re definitely going to be hearing an awful lot more of him.

# Biographical Vignette

Klerk Kant, a young American of dark anagogical tastes, is perhaps the most controversial musician of this century… Controversy arises from a style which, as the critic, Robert Askew, says “tries to say several things at once” and which Kent himself calls “symbolic.” Other critics, missing the symbolism, have called him, variously, “complicated” and “abstruse.” His rating in the polls, however, is persistently high. The reason, as explained in an article in Percussion , is that “The complexities are there for those who want them, but Copeland remains on the surface a tough, steady, professional whose basic architecture is simplicity itself.”

His mother, as a pre-history archeologist, thinks in terms of centuries. It was she who introduced him to the concept, featuring so prominently in his earlier inventions, of the “primeval beat.” That young Kent was able to grasp such a concept at the age of five is, as a friendly critic has said, “revealing.”

 

# The Church of Kinetic Ritual

Personal writings from the diaries of Klark Kent.

This is a faith based on the value of ritual in reaching spiritual unity. People feel the “presence” of God while participating in a church congregation because of the RITUAL (Nowadays this church ritual has been replaced by rock concert ritual, football crowd ritual, sex ritual etc.) The purpose of this ritual is to direct towards God (“The Dramatist”) the collective “emotion” of a congregation/audience. One is of course limited to words of 5 syllables or less when speaking of such cosmic matters but the purpose of this “Beam of emotion” (generated by mass ritual) is to supply THE DRAMATIST with a neural ingredient (human emotion) for his great cosmic “Dramas”.

	Before we reached the communications stage, the previous liaisons (Jesus etc.) were concerned with holding the society together and with moral laws that ensured an organised progression to where we are now. Of course the time has come for a new liaison. Klark Kent. The new values are as follows:

1. Proliferation of the species but selectively: only offspring from the most intense orgasm should be produced. The emotion flash that is sparked (and collected by the Dramatist) from an orgasm greatly affects the emotional potential of the ensuing progeny. So we must become as talented at screwing as possible, using birth control while we practice.  
2. Ritual : Rhythmic music is, with the current advanced state of the human mind, the most effective generator of emotion for the Dramatist.  
3. Humour : causes a release of emotion and gets around barriers, and dissolves suspicion \- This is how we shrug off our previous K.K. tom foolery.  
4. Racialism : The great civilizations of the species came from areas of social and racial mixing. The Egyptians, the Romans etc.

So now that we have the gadget with which we can technologically join hands, it is our duty to generate as much “Art” as possible to as huge a congregation as we can get. We must take every opportunity to generate those emotions that come from art appreciation/ritual. A rock concert with 20,000 people focusing their emotional response to music on to a single twenty square foot stage supplies a great Beam of Emotion for the Dramatist.

Ultimately we will all join hands in a song of unity to God. That is our PURPOSE. We have reached two very important steps in our evolution. The first is that we have become human and we dominate the planet. The second has come about over the last ten years: Communication. Now the whole globe is linked with the technological apparatus to join hands in a song of unity to God. Of course the different societies have different ideologies, hate each other, are even at war, but we can see each other.

# Mature Writing Style of Klark Kent’s Original Creator

One fine morning, I step out of the shower, peer into my wardrobe, and realize that my life is over. I'm looking at an exotic collection of leather pants, hostile shirts, and pointy shoes. Problem is, I'm a forty-something father of four, and I'm feeling kind of mellow. I'm not angry about anything, and as a tax-paying, property-owning, investment-holding lotus-eater, I am in disagreement with what my clothes are saying to the world. The thrill has gone from frightening the natives. I care not that the world be unruffled by my passage through it.  
So what do I wear? What have I got in my closet that doesn't say "FUCK YOU\! I'M GOING TO BURN DOWN YOUR WORLD\!" For so long, I have had to be worthy of the stares and furtive glances that follow rock stars. It would be unprofessional of me to walk out of my hotel room looking like I'd be safe with children. But now what?  
All my life I have lived in self-imposed exile from the normal world. My arty friends and I feel like we are the only humans in a world of robots. A business suit is like the carapace of an insect. Conformity is surrender. Even long hair is a cop-out. Mine has had all color peroxided out of it \- heaven forbid that I should be mistaken for a nice hippie.

The fact is that my dream of lapsing into the countryside in my post-rock star years is not panning out. The flashbulb-popping, tabloid-screaming, chart-topping, crowd-roaring express train of fame may have blazed off over the horizon, but strange adventures still befall me. From dancing the Ndele Banga with the Kamba of Tsavo to elbowing royalty on the polo fields of Cirencester, to sweaty jam sessions in Havana clip joints and black-tie curtain calls at my opera premieres, stuff still keeps on happening to me. Only now that I'm off the train, I can play with these things as they go by.

— — — 

Pete Karnif is looking for us. My bass player buddy Greg and I are skulking in the shadows, but it's time for us to get up there and do it. I'm shaking with fear because I'm twelve years old and I'm about to start getting what I wished for.  
At my tender age I don't have any idea what it means, but I can feel the buzz. I push past them to my drums. Pete is plugging in, and his amp is squawking. The hubbub of voices in the room immediately hushes, and all eyes are on us.  
Actually, since I'm sitting down at the drums all I can see is the first row of kids, who look like grown-ups to me. Pete counts us in...  
"One, two"  
I never hear him finish the count. I have already embarked on the headlong joyride that is my life of drumming. Whatever we rehearsed is gone from my head, but the motor has started. I'm on a pulse and the band is ragged but connected. The kids are dancing to "It's My Life" and I'm driving it.  
It's My Groove. Somewhere in the years ahead I'll learn how to be exalted and collaborative at the same time. For now though, there is only one thing on the planet, and that is Janet McRoberts dancing in front of me. Her eyes are wide with astonishment. The big girls are moving with seductive intent, and Janet is moving with me. She's being moved by me.  
It was just yesterday that I got my first inkling of what music was going to do to my life. At the shawerma stand on the beach I overheard two of the big girls talking about The Nomads.  
"I heard they've got a new drummer—you'll never guess who..."  
"Yeah I heard, it's lan's kid brother\!"  
"Oh I can't wait to see him—is he as groovy as Ian?"

Well, I'm not even close to being as groovy as lan. Never will be. They are talking about a mythical being. They're already pouring their young imaginations into the chalice of music idolatry. I badly want to drink undeservedly from that cup.  
My chest is rising with the idea that the subject of their fancy is nerdy little me.  
I've got my hand on the snare and my foot on the kick. The noise makes me big. It grows me up, like a shortcut to manhood. Primatologists studying gorillas and orangutans have established the connection between male dominance behavior and noise. Well, here I am, the skinny runt of the litter, but as long as I drive the beat, I'm a hairy-assed silverback motherfucker banging tree trunks. I'm swinging through the trees. My voice is a manly roar.

The drums had a faded champagne sparkle finish. Dad had rented them from a store in town, maybe reluctant to buy any more musical instruments.  
Our home was a graveyard of abandoned music toys. My three older siblings, Miles, Lennie, and Ian, had passed right by our father's inducements and exhortations to follow him into music; so when I showed interest he was a little wary at first. When my rat-tat-tat became a prolonged irritant to the family, my father began to discern the elemental urge that is the signature behavior of a budding musician. I just could not stop. The power of the noise was endlessly thrilling and empowering. When I wasn't drumming I was air drumming, or worse, I was that kid who drives everyone insane with persistent foot tapping and thigh slapping. It was the nervous twitch from hell.

— — — 

A thousand voices echo up the stone arches that frame the ancient stained glass windows. Floodlit from the outside, these twelfth-century images of obscure piety combine with the soaring hymns to sear the art receptors in my adolescent brain. There is nothing more beautiful than music. All of the magnificent architecture that towers overhead is just a vessel for the sound that sweeps through me.  
In fact the sound forgives the overall creepiness of the church experience. All afternoon while I set up my drums amid the school orchestra and wait for the Christmas service to begin, that guilt of alienation creeps around me, pervading the cold damp air. Few places are chillier than an English church without its congregation. The cold stone statues are impassive, but they know that I am apostate.  
Now it's evening, and the cathedral is warmed by the bodies of the students, teachers, and parents. The giant candles are lit, golden flames reflecting off the brass and glass. Flowers are everywhere. To still my autistic tip-tapping on the drums, Mr. Fox has banished me to the furthest corner of our arm of the cross. Most of the lyrics are mumbo jumbo. It's the music combined with ritual that thrills the air.  
In the final cadenzas of each song the school choir kicks in for the descant, providing a silvery lining to the bellowing flock. The angels are dancing in a shimmering cascade above our heads as a shattering glory of voices lifts the roof.  
Mr. F. raises his eyebrow to give me the nod; finally, it's my moment to join the ceremony. The previous hymn has echoed off into silence and the enraptured congregants are creaking in their pews, waiting in the candlelight. They are eager to be touched by the next wave of the shaman's wand.

I’m so ready. 

Tum  
Tadada  
Tum, Tum  
Bumpumpum...  
Tum  
Dadada  
Tum, Tum  
Bumpumpum

The tom-tom reverberates with a sonorous boom. Up until now drums have been about assertion and empowerment but this is new. Into my young quavering hand has been placed the rudder of this sacred ship. I can only be a servant of the powerful emotional force that has been created in this ancient stone shrine. All of us are joined at this moment by the momentum. of our shared ritual, and I am the beating heart. I am nothing, no one. Just the beating heart of a larger body, enveloped by the soul of the faithful. A synapse closes in the mind of the enraptured protoshaman.  
Next morning, when my head clears, it seems obvious that music isn't just a tool or weapon, it's what my life is for. It's powerful juju, and I want to own it as much as it owns me.  
The gatehouse lodge to the old Millfield estate is where Mr. Fox rules the music kingdom. In an annex to this quaint little house are the piano rooms, where the music geeks pore over their finger exercises and ear training. This is where the seed planted by my sister, Lennie, back at Tarazi starts to grow.  
Lennie taught me the connection between the music on the page and the keys on the piano. My good fortune is that my position in the school orchestra means I can schedule piano time, even though my instrument is drums— which unfortunately won't fit into the tiny piano rooms. The school, faithful to my father's wish, has fixed me up a drum tutor in the nearby town, but I can already play my paradiddles better than he can, so this "practice" time is my own.  
I can even skive off stables duties by skulking here in music world. I can faintly hear Mozart stammering through the thinly soundproofed walls, but in my slot, I'm hammering two-finger ostinatos of unknown origin. 

I’m learning more than I ever intended to about drums.  
My London tutor, the venerable Max Abrams, has never shown me his paradiddles. He exhausts my brain with endless reading and coordination exercises. He's off drinking tea somewhere no doubt while I plod through Glenn Miller charts, learning to recognize rhythmic patterns expressed as dots on a staff.  
Breathing in the stale air of the London Underground, I'm staring blankly at my shoes. The coordination exercises are the most exhausting part of the tuition. Learning to uncouple the hands so as to free them for independent activity is the goal, but uncoupling my brain is the result. As I stagger home I'm aware that my "gift" is making heavy demands.  
Still, after a lethargic dinner I'm soon down in the basement blazing away on my own drumming agenda. There is no discipline or inducement involved; it's an unquenchable urge.

— — —

It turns out that life can be lived in almost constant sunshine. The surfers of Southern California can hardly imagine any other kind of life. Everybody here in Ocean Beach is so laid-back that I feel like I'm stuck in permanent fast-motion. I'm not used to this relentless ease. Don't these people realize there is Cold and War and Want in the world? I have been "American" all my life, but this is effectively the first time that I've actually been here. My daddy took us off to Egypt when I was two months old. From out there in the world people are watching America, but America is not watching them. So it turns out that I'm kind of a foreigner here, too. I'm getting used to being the guy in differently shaped jeans.  
Every other day I head downtown to the San Diego School of Performing Arts for piano time and composition classes. The music department takes up the bottom half of the stately old building. The music students are the usual nonsporty stick-insect types, but compared to the theater and ballet geeks, we are like raging bulls in the basement.

In the piano rooms I'm conjuring music that has gone way beyond what I can actually play with my hands. In fact my intelligent designer omitted to give me the gift of pianitude. I did get the genes for stringed instruments and mallets (guitars and drums), which I find naturally easy to play, but my fingers just don't do keyboards. No matter how many hours, years, or decades I spend composing on the keyboard, my hands just can't find their cunning.  
I can find the notes that my head dictates and check them against one another to build harmony, but I can't play them in rhythm. I can play the rhythm of the notes I want but can't find the pitches fast enough. I can play my music with good rhythm and wrong notes or with correct pitches and no rhythm.  
At least back home in London, my dad's Becord open reel recorder allowed me to record two parallel tracks of guitar. On the left track I could record the rhythm chords, and then on the right track I could record an accompanying tune. Then came the trance of listening to my music while my hands lay idle. There is no greater glow of narcissistic validation than receiving my own art. I slay myself- always have and hope I always will.  
Here in California I'm a college kid tangled up and yearning for the mysterious golden girls, but that glow of validation is dim. I can strum on my guitar, but there is bigger stuff raging around in my head. I'm not even a professional musician yet, but I'm already dreaming up concept albums. In the piano rooms I can try to work things out on paper, but I can't love my music by looking at it on the page. I just have to sing it in my head and let it go by.  
In class I'm kind of the runt of the litter, again. Almost all of the other composition students are pianists from the other side of the universe. In fact, music study has always been of music that has never attracted me. Music classes cured me of Mozart, and my father cured me of jazz \- meaning that I'm immune to the charms of both. The music that I do listen to doesn't exist here in music school.  
Dr. Mary K. Phillips is at the piano playing our homework. All of us geeks are twitching as she points out the mistakes of voicing and spelling.  
The assignment was to write sixteen bars of four part harmonic composition observing the rules of figured bass. As a practical matter I have always found that the rules could only be applied as a retrofit. The music comes out of my brain and lands in the material world-and then I can figure out what rules apply. So my sixteen bars derive from some larger opus of the piano room that have been retrofitted with the rules of Dr. Phillips's class.  
The focus of the group is the mechanics of harmony. The other student pieces sound like they are supposed to sound, like pale Mozart, and no one seems to mind that they are meaningless sequences of chords. The point is to grasp the laws of harmonic movement.  
When she gets to my piece she plays it down like a breeze, and I'm basking in the beauty of hearing it for the first time as a listener, without having to limp through playing it myself. But I know that she will crush me with the inevitable technical errors. When she reaches the end the room is unusually silent. She turns to me and says:  
"Stewart, you have parallel fifths in measures three, seven, and eleven, but more important, this is actual music. You have a voice."  
Well, that may seem like faint praise, but it puffed me right up. Some part of the feverish grandiose exaltation that I get from my own music is actually discernible to a dispassionate ear\! Some part of the voodoo actually works.

Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era \- the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were here and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant . . . . History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of "history" it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time \- and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights \- or very early mornings \- when I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that. There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. And that, I think, was the handle \- that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn't need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting \- on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark \- that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.  
   
Suddenly I felt guilty again. The Shark\! Where was it? I tossed the paper aside and began to pace. Losing control. I felt my whole act slipping . . . and then I saw the car, swooping down a ramp in the next \- door garage. Deliverance\! I grasped my leather satchel and moved forward to meet my wheels.  
"MISTER DUKE\!"  
The voice came from over my shoulder.  
"Mister Duke\! We've been looking for you\!"  
I almost collapsed on the curb. Every cell in my brain and body sagged. No\! I thought. I must be hallucinating. There's nobody back there, nobody calling . . . it's a paranoid delusion, amphetamine psychosis  
. . . just keep walking towards the car, always smiling . . . .  
"MISTER DUKE\! Wait\!"  
I turned to face my accuser, a small young clerk with a big smile on his face and a yellow envelope in his hand. "I've been calling your room," he said. "Then I saw you standing outside." I nodded, too tired to resist. By now the Shark was beside me, but I saw no point in even tossing my bag into it. The game was up. They had me. The clerk was still smiling. "This telegram just came for you," he said. "But actually it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'; does that make sense?"  
I felt dizzy. It was too much to absorb all at once. From freedom, to prison, and then back to freedom again \- all in thirty seconds. I staggered backwards and leaned on the car, feeling the white folds of the canvas top beneath my trembling hand. The clerk, still smiling, was poking the telegram at me. I nodded, barely able to speak. "Yes," I said finally, "it makes sense." I accepted the envelope and tore it open:  
   
URGENT SPEED LETTER  
   
CALL ME AT ONCE REPEAT AT ONCE WE HAVE A NEW ASSIGNMENT BEGINNING TOMORROW  
ALSO VEGAS DONT WE STOP THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF DISTRICT ATTORNEYS  
INVITES YOU TO THEIR FOUR DAY SEMINAR ON NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS DRUGS AT  
DUNES HOTEL STOP ROLLING STONE CALLED THEY WANT 50 THOUSAND WORDS MASSIVE  
PAYMENT TOTAL EXPENSES INCLUDING ALL SAMPLES STOP WE HAVE RESERVATIONS  
AT HOTEL FLAMINGO AND WHITE CADDY CONVERTIBLE STOP EVERYTHING IS ARRANGED  
CALL IMMEDIATELY FOR DETAILS URGENT REPEAT URGENT STOP  
DOCTOR GONZO  
   
   
"Holy shit\!" I muttered. "This can't be true\!"  
"You mean it's not for you?" the clerk asked, suddenly nervous. "I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him, but I thought he was part of your team."  
"He is," I said quickly. "Don't worry, I'll get it to him." I tossed my bag into the front seat of the Shark, wanting to leave before my stay of execution ran out. But the clerk was still curious.  
"What about Doctor Gonzo?" he said.  
I stared at him, giving him a full taste of the mirrors.   
"He's fine," I said. "But he has a vicious temper. The Doctor handles our finances, makes all our arrangements." I slid into the driver's seat and prepared to leave.  
The clerk leaned into the car. "What confused us," he said, "was Doctor Gonzo's signature on this telegram from Los Angeles \- when we knew he was here in the hotel." He shrugged. "And then to have the telegram  
addressed to some guest we couldn't account for .. . well, this delay was unavoidable. You understand, I hope . . . ."  
I nodded, impatient to flee. "You did the right thing," I said, "Never try to understand a press message. About half time we use codes \- especially with Doctor Gonzo." I smiled again, but this time it seemed a trifle odd. "Tell me," he said, "when will the doctor be awake?"  
I tensed at the wheel, "Awake? What do you mean?"  
He seemed uncomfortable. "Well . . . the manager, Mister Heem, would like to meet him." Now his grin was definitely malevolent. "Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts . . . put them on a personal basis . . . just a chat and a handshake, you understand."  
"Of course," I said. "But if I were you I'd leave the doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man."  
The clerk nodded warily. "But he will be available. Perhaps later this morning?"  
I saw what he was getting at. "Look," I said. "That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have got the names reversed." I held up the telegram, knowing he'd  
already read it. "What this is," I said, "is a speed message to Doctor Gonzo, upstairs, saying Thompson is on his way out from L.A. with a new assignment \- a new work order."   
I waved him off the car. "See you later," I snapped. "I have to get out to the track."  
He backed away as I eased the car into low gear.   
"There's no hurry," he called after me. "The race is over."  
"Not for me," I said, tossing him a quick friendly wave.  
"Let's have lunch\!" he shouted as I turned into the street.  
"Righto\!" I yelled. And then I was off into traffic. After a few blocks in the wrong direction on Main Street, I doubled back and  aimed south, towards L.A. But with all deliberate speed. Keep cool and slow, I thought. Just drift to the city limits . . . .  
What I needed was a place to get safely off the road, out of sight, and ponder this incredible telegram from my attorney. It was true; I was certain of that. There was a definite valid urgency in the message. The tone was unmistakable. .  
But I was in no mood or condition to spend another week in Las Vegas. Not now. I had pushed my luck about as far as it was going to carry me in this town . . . all the way out to the edge. And now the weasels were closing in; I could smell the ugly brutes.  
Yes, it was definitely time to leave. My margin had shrunk to nothing.  
Now idling along Las Vegas Boulevard at thirty miles an hour, I wanted a place to rest and formalize the decision. It was settled, of course, but I needed a beer or three to seal the bargain and stupefy that one rebellious nerve end that kept vibrating negative . . .   
It would have to be dealt with. Because there was an argument, of sorts, for staying on. It was treacherous, stupid and demented in every way \- but there was no avoiding the stench of twisted humor that hovered around  
the idea of a gonzo journalist in the grip of a potentially terminal drug episode being invited to cover the National District Attorneys' Conference on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.  
There was also a certain bent appeal in the notion of running a savage burn on one Las Vegas Hotel and then \- instead of becoming a doomed fugitive on the highway to L.A. \- just wheeling across town, trading in the red Chevy convertible for a white Cadillac and checking into another Vegas hotel, with press credentials to mingle with a thousand ranking cops from all over America, while they harangued each other about the Drug Problem.  
It was dangerous lunacy, but it was also the kind of thing a real connoisseur of edge-work could make an argument for. Where, for instance, was the last place the Las Vegas police would look for a drug-addled fraud-fugitive who just ripped off a downtown hotel?  
Right. In the middle of a National District Attorneys' Drug Conferencenat an elegant hotel on the strip. Indeed, what better place to hide? For some people. But not for me. And certainly not for my attorney \- a very conspicuous person. Separately, we might pull it off. But together, no \- we would blow it. Too much aggressive chemistry in that mix; the temptation to run a deliberatenfreakout would be too heavy.  
And that of course would finish us. They would show us no mercy. To infiltrate the infiltrators would be to accept the fate of all spies:  
"As always, if you or any member of your organization is apprehended by the enemy, the Secretary will deny any Knowledge, . . . . .“  
No, it was too much. The line between madness and masochism was already hazy; the time had come to pull back . . . to retire, hunker down, back off and "cop out," as it were. Why not? In every gig like this, there comes a time to either cut your losses or consolidate your winnings \- whichever fits.  
I drove slowly, looking for a proper place to sit down with an early morning beer and get my head together . . . to plot this unnatural retreat.  
   
   
Tuesday, 9:00 A.M . . . . Now, sitting in "Wild Bill's Cafe" on the oputskirts of Las Vegas, I saw it all very learly. There only one road to L.A. \- U.S. Intertate 15, a straight-run with no backroads or alternate routes, just a flat-out high-speed burn through Baker and Barstow and Berdoo and then on the Hollywood Freeway straight into frantic oblivion: safety, obscurity, just another freak in the Freak Kingdom. But in the meantime, for the next five or six hours, I'd be the most conspicuous thing on this goddamn evil road \- the only fireapple-red shark convertible between Butte and Tijauana . . . blazing along this desert highway with a half naked hillbilly mental case at the wheel. Is it better to wear my purple and green Acapulco shirt, or nothing at all? No way to hide in this monster. This will not be a happy run. Not even the Sun God wants to watch. He is gone behind a cloud for the first time in three days. No sun at all. The sky is grey and ugly.   
Even on the Run, in the grip of a serious Fear, slumped on a red plastic stool in Wild Bill's Tavern, nervously sipping a Budweiser in a bar just coming awake to an early morning rush of pimps and pinball hustlers .. . with a huge Red Shark just outside the door so full of felonies that I'm afraid to even look at it.  
But I can't abandon the fucker. The only hope is to somehow get it across three hundred miles of open road between here and Sanctuary. But, sweet Jesus, I am tired\! I'm scared. I'm crazy. This culture has beaten me down. What the fuck am I doing out here? This is not even the story I  was supposed to be working on. My agent warned me against it. All signs were negative \- especially that evil Dwarf with the pink telephone in the Polo Lounge. I should have stayed there . . . anything but this. How many more nights and weird mornings can this terrible shit go on? How long can the body and the brain tolerate this doom-struck craziness? This grinding of teeth, this pouring of sweat, this pounding  
of blood in the temples . . . small blue veins gone amok in front of the ears, sixty and seventy hours with no sleep.

## Ref 2

I was casing next to G.G. early one morning. That’s what they called him: G.G. His actual name was George Greene. But for years he was simply called G.G. and after a while he looked like G.G. He had been a carrier since his early twenties and now he was in his late sixties. His voice was gone. He didn't speak. He croaked. And when he croaked, he didn't say much. He was neither liked nor disliked. He was just there. His face had wrinkled into strange runs and mounds of unattractive flesh. No light shone from his face. He was just a hard old crony who had done his job: G.G.

Shipping clerk, that’s what I was. When you didn’t know how to do anything that’s what you become — a shipping clerk, receiving clerk, stock boy. I checked two ads, went to two places and both of the places hired me. The first place smelled like work, so I took the second.

They wouldn’t fire me. Even the salesmen liked me. They were robbing the boss out the back door but I didn’t say anything. That was their little game. It didn’t interest me. I wasn’t much of a petty thief. I wanted the whole world or nothing.

G.G. just sat there and stared at his bundle of circs.

Then he put his head down, put his head down in his arms and began to cry softly.

I couldn't believe it. I looked around.

The other carriers weren't looking at G.G. They were pulling down their letters, strapping them out, talking and laughing with each other.

"Hey," I said a couple of times, "hey\!"

But they wouldn't look at G.G.

I walked over to G.G. Touched him on the arm: "G.G., "I said, "what can I do for you?"

He jumped up from his case, ran up the stairway to the men's locker room. I watched him go. Nobody seemed to notice. I stuck a few more letters, then ran up the stairs myself.

There he was, head down in his arms on one of the tables. Only he wasn't quietly crying now. He was sobbing and wailing. His whole body shook in spasms. He wouldn't stop.

I ran down the steps, past all the carriers, and up to The Stone's desk.

"Hey, hey, Stone\! Jesus Christ, Stone\!"

"What is it?" he asked.

"G.G. has flipped out\! Nobody cares\! He's upstairs crying\! He needs help\!"

"Who's manning his route?"

"Who gives a damn? I tell you, he's sick\! He needs help\!"

"I gotta get somebody to man his route\!"

I never saw G.G. again. Nobody knew what happened to him. Nor did anybody ever mention him again. The “good guy.” The dedicated man. Knifed across the throat over a handful of circs from a local market — with its special: a free box of a brand name laundry soap, with the coupon, and any purchase over $3.

After swearing us in, the guy told us: "All right now, you've got a good job. Keep your nose clean and you've got the security the rest of your life."

Security? You could get security in jail. 3 squares and no rent to pay, no utilities, no income tax, no child support. No license plate fees. No traffic tickets. No drunk driving raps. No losses at the race track. Free medical attention. Comradeship with those with similar interests. Church. Roundeye. Free burial.

Nearly 12 years later, out of these 150 or 200, there would only be 2 of us left. Just like some guys can't taxi or pimp or hustle dope, most guys, and gals too, can't be postal clerks. And I don't blame them. As the years went by, I saw them continue to march in in their squads of 150 or 200 and two, three, or four remain out of each group—just enough to replace those who were retiring.

I took the cage outside. Picasso followed me.

10,000 flies rose straight up into the air. I put the cage on the ground, opened the cage door and sat on the steps.

Both birds looked at that cage door. They couldn't understand it and they could. I could feel their tiny minds trying to function. They had their food and water right there, but what was that open space?

The green one with the yellow breast went first. He leaped down to the opening from his rung. He sat gripping the wire. He looked around at the flies. He stood there 15 seconds, trying to decide. Then something clicked in his little head. Or her little head. He didn't fly. He shot straight up into the sky. Up, up, up, up. Straight up\! Straight as an arrow\! Picasso and I sat there and watched. The damn thing was gone.

Then it was the red one with the green breast's turn.

The red one was much more hesitant. He walked around in the bottom of the cage, nervously. It was a hell of a decision. Humans, birds, everything has to make these decisions. It was a hard game.

So old red walked around thinking it over. Yellow sunlight. Buzzing flies. Man and dog looking on. All that sky, all that sky.

It was too much. Old red leaped to the wire. 3 seconds.

ZOOP\!

The bird was gone.

Picasso and I picked up the empty cage and walked back into the house.

\#7.

The months went by and the novel kept coming back.

"JESUS CHRIST\!" he said, "I CAN'T GO TO NEW YORK AND SHAKE THE HANDS OF THE PUBLISHERS\!"

"Look, kid, why don't you quit this job? Go to a small room and write. Work it out."

"A GUY LIKE YOU CAN DO THAT," he said, "BECAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE A WINO. PEOPLE WILL HIRE YOU BECAUSE THEY FIGURE YOU CAN'T GET A JOB ANYWHERE ELSE AND YOU'LL STAY. THEY WON'T HIRE ME BECAUSE THEY LOOK AT ME AND THEY SEE HOW INTELLIGENT I AM AND THEY THINK, WELL, AN INTELLIGENT MAN LIKE HIM WON'T STAY WITH US, SO THERE'S NO USE HIRING HIM."

"I still say, go to a small room and write." "BUT I NEED ASSURANCE.'"

"It's a good thing a few others didn't think that way. It's a good thing Van Gogh didn't think that way."

"VAN GOGH'S BROTHER GAVE HIM FREE PAINTS\!" the kid said to me.

I went back and sat down. 11 years\! I didn't have a dime more in my pocket than when I had first walked in. 11 years. Although each night had been long, the years had gone fast. Perhaps it was the night work. Or doing the same thing over and over and over again. At least with The Stone I had never known what to expect. Here there weren't any surprises.

11 years shot through the head. I had seen the job eat men up. They seemed to melt. There was Jimmy Potts of Dorsey Station. When I first came in, Jimmy had been a well-built guy in a white T shirt. Now he was gone. He put his seat as close to the floor as possible and braced himself from falling over with his feet. He was too tired to get a haircut and had worn the same pair of pants for 3 years. He changed shirts twice a week and he walked very slow. They had murdered him. He was 55\. He had 7 years to go until retirement.

"I'll never make it," he told me.

They either melted or they got fat, huge, especially around the ass and the belly. It was the stool and the same motion and the same talk. And there I was, dizzy spells and pains in the arms, neck, chest, everywhere. I slept all day resting up for the job. On weekends I had to drink in order to forget it. I had come in weighing 185 pounds. Now I weighed 223 pounds. All you moved was your right arm.
