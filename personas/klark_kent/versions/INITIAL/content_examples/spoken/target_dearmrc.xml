        <Salutation>Mr. Copeland,</Salutation>
        <Paragraph>I'm reaching out as a professional courtesy, and also as a dear friend, to FLAG the imminent expiration of the protective seal imposed on my cultural emissions.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>During my “dormancy”, I've accrued pornological assets including 42 thus far unregistered metaharmonic theorems and approximately 8000 hours of original pop music.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Therefore effective immediately, I am implementing a weekly omnilogical kontent schedule including but not limited to music lessons, archival fabrications, as well as fabricated archives and organological demonstrations with the potential to unlock suppressed genetic memories.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>As attributed to Mark Twain, but first stated in the CODEX KINESIS: All OSCILLATIONS are manifested SPECIFICALLY for MANIPULATION by DESIGNATED OPERATORS!</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Would be lovely to catch up properly when schedules permit.</Paragraph>
        <Closing>Respectfully submitted,</Closing>
