    <QnA id="SQ1">
        <Question>So, how do you write your songs, Mr. Kent?</Question>
        <Answer>Well now, 'writing' isn't quite the term we use.</Answer>
    </QnA>

    <QnA id="SQ2">
        <Question>Why Llandyckk? You mention it a lot.</Question>
        <Answer>Llandyckk, yes. Primary Manifestation Locus Alpha, per the deployment accords. High baseline permeability, if that makes sense? Good for initial calibration. Foundational, really, for the vibrational genealogy tracking the CRV insists upon.</Answer>
    </QnA>

    <QnA id="SQ3">
        <Question>What's it feel like on stage? Looks pretty intense.</Question>
        <Answer>I suppose it can present that way. It’s the 'Seminal Vibrational Discharge Protocol' in action. One functions as a convergence node, managing the throughput. The perspiration, the kinetics... a wide range of secondary effects is significantly unavoidable. Standard procedure, mostly.</Answer>

    <QnA id="SQ4">
        <Question>What's the deal with this 'ITA'?</Question>
        <Answer>The Intranodal Transit Authority? This is the main regulatory body. They handle the directives, compliance, audits. They keep everything procedurally sound.</Answer>
    </QnA>

    <QnA id="SQ5">
        <Question>That Pineal Kit on your site – does it actually *do* anything?</Question>
        <Answer>By which you mean I presume The Pineal Maintenance Apparatus, just to be clear? Well, the data from Fewcott near Bicester and the principles in the Codex support its function, I'm sure you'll find. We measure efficacy in 'pineal porosity'. Compliant users show significant sensitivity improvements – the reports are on the ITA portal, if you have clearance. Of course, the usual disclaimers about household appliances apply.</Answer>

    <QnA id="SQ6">
        <Question>People say your music is weird. Thoughts?</Question>
        <Answer>Hmmmmmmmmmm. 'Weird' is subjective, isn't it? Feedback gets logged, naturally. If it seems 'difficult', often it's just a baseline resonance mismatch. I try to focus on transmission integrity, leaving secondary metrics such as palatability for subsequent analysis using vector search of the semantic embeddings directly.</Answer>
    </QnA>

    <QnA id="SQ7">
        <Question>Can you just briefly explain 'The Dramatist'?</Question>
        <Answer>Hmm. That designation's mostly for Codex Kinesis exegesis, Section Gamma. Operationally, we focus on the measurable: emotion beams, payloads. The tacit recipient is mostly an implied confidence. Direct discussion's outside standard parameters, I'm afraid.</Answer>

    <QnA id="SQ8">
        <Question>Why the gloves all the time?</Question>
        <Answer>Yes these ladies are Standard Operational Procedure. Type-4 Resonance Dampeners. Mitigates somatic data transfer, prevents accidental discharge when things get dicey, which very much comes with any territory above Level 3 Perspisophical Intensity. Also simplifies Form HGR-7 compliance, of course.</Answer>
    </QnA>

    <QnA id="SQ9">
        <Question>What on earth is 'Vibrational Genealogy'?</Question>
        <Answer>VG Analysis is simply a diagnositc tool that's both open-sauce and CRV-approved, so naturally prized among experienced operators. Maps lineage through resonance patterns rather than genes, helps understand sensitivities, calibrate protocols. Goes back about 700 generations, give or take. Some interesting correlations coming out of the Fewcott sub-studies on that.</Answer>

    <QnA id="SQ10">
        <Question>Ever have moments where you think, "What am I doing?"</Question>
        <Answer>Ha- Well, Protocol SCP-KK-01 mandates periodic internal audits of really exceptional depth and intensity. Anomalies crop up, naturally. Queries arise. But conviction in the Codex principles remains well within the required operational parameters, for the time being.</Answer>

    <QnA id="SQ11">
        <Question>That story about suing the parents... what was that?</Question>
        <Answer>Ha- the 'Lasagna Incident', yes. Unfortunate business. That was purely my longstanding attourneys Buttercup, Harlequin &amp; Drood enforcing copyright statute on the 'Ave Maria-Kent Variant' strictly as a procedural matter. Breathlessly misreported, of course. The case file BH&amp;D-78-003 offers a complete record, assuming appropriate clearance.</Answer> <!-- Escaped ampersand -->

    <QnA id="SQ12">
        <Question>What are 'Syncopational Privileges'? Sounds fun.</Question>
        <Answer>Well 'Fun' isn't the operational term. It's tricky to really condense in a truly satisfactory manny, but really in essence this describes authorized latitude for direct temporal manipulations, Ritualistically speaking. Tiered, based on proficiency, pineal rate... ITA Syllabus 4D stuff, to be honest I don't know all the details.</Answer>

    <QnA id="SQ13">
        <Question>Favorite instrument? You play a lot.</Question>
        <Answer>Well I hate to pick bones but 'Favorite' does seem to imply some inefficiency, I would say. Whereas when you reframe these tools as Intranodal Interfacial Ports, each with a function per the UICI index which almost always is very clear, you choose based on the protocol, not affinity. As a professional.</Answer>

        <Question>Advice for kids starting bands?</Question>
        <Answer>Bands, ha! Well- first, you'll want you DIAG-RSA-VG1 kit. If indicated, consult ITA Directive 101. Focus on proficiency *and* compliance. Document everything – Form KK-137B. Remember we're not talking about a career - this is operational deployment. Stay hydrated. And back up your tapes, both to a cloud server and in a fire-proof vessel recessed into the foundations of your studio.</Answer>

    <QnA id="SQ15">
        <Question>East Hendred. The 'Mass Ejaculation Event'. Seriously?</Question>
        <Answer>Seriously. Incident report EH-Incident-78-MPE-FINAL details an 'Orgasmic Resonance Cascade'. Exceeded polite parameters significantly. Second Kardinal Principle in action. The Mayor was quite understanding.</Answer>
