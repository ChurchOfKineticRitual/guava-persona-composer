            <Paragraph>This restricted portal serves Designated Operators and Certified Practitioners seeking to requisition formally sanctioned ritual tools and expendables as directly encouraged under Codex Kinesis and subsequently verified by the Church of Kinetic Ritual (CKR).</Paragraph>
            <WarningBox>
                <Title>POLITE WARNING:</Title>
                <Content>Unauthorised access or attempted requisition by non-designated personnel constitutes a violation of Temporal Integrity Statute 4C.317 and may result in swift chronymic decoherence. All practitioners are responsible for maintaining functional familiarity with the assets requisitioned. Failure to adhere to operational parameters may compromise ritual integrity, attract unsanctioned oversight, or induce spontaneous regulatory phenomena. Proceed with diligence.</Content>

                    <Content>The perception or reporting of any listed anomalies may trigger automatic review under the Non-Voluntary Ontological Disclosure Scheme (NVODS). Persistent episodes must be logged using Form Q-17 (“Involuntary Entrainment Manifestation Report”) and counter-signed by a qualified Interoceptive Liaison Officer (ILO) within 72 hours. All qualia are subject to retroactive classification under the Unified Oscillatory Interpretability Framework (UOIF), and failure to report may result in procedural liminality or, in rare cases, memetic seepage beyond Class-B containment thresholds. By remaining within visual range of this advisory, you consent to subliminal internodal monitoring under the Provisional Emotion Beam Mandate (PEBM).</Content>
